# QMMM2

### TODO

- Accuracy test on training set : CO
- Convergence Tests : CO
- think about test sets : CO & HC
- Lattice relaxation: HC
   - comparison of gap and locality for relaxed / unrelaxed
   - create training set for relaxed
- force-based training data: HC (no rush)
- virial-based training data: CO & HC (no rush)
   - first need TB virials
- implement training of d3Es
- Implement Energy-mixing + ghost-force test
- Implement a point defect test problem
